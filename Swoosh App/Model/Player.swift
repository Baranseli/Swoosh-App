// use struct when using default swift type strings and etc. Struct is a value type so copied directly. Struct much faster than class.
// use class when have to do have custom things implemented. Like your own custom classes. Class is object stored in memory, so you can't copy it.

    var desiredLeague : String!
    var selectedSkillLevel : String!
}
